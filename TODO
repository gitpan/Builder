    Continue to improve docs - Document other (hidden) features!?
    Add more tests - more complicated sub/loop tests (see my original example dir) - also other from older tests
     - (More checks on mixed content of subs, text & objects)
    Bring git (GitHub) up-to-date with latest version in my SVN
     - Above includes CSS module
     - Putting back in comments & <? ?> tags - And helpers
     - DocTypes &  DTD <!ELEMENT>
    Add subs saving to Builder::XML (benchmark first)
    Create Builder::HTML & Builder::HTML::Validated
    Refactor! Refactor! Refactor!
    Nick tests from XML::Writer & XML::Generator and amend for Builder::XML
    Fix order of attributes? (ie. document workaround)
    
    # from Builder::XML....
    # Builder::Declare (for Builder func import)
    * building subs (for speed).   Lets do benchmarking before attempting this!
    * XML::Entities    (option to decode on reading data & to encode on way out)
    * AUTOLOAD & DESTROY tags - solution?
    * test B::XML __render__ does work on local stack only (done this?  certainly needs more stringent tests)
    
    # doesnt work...   $xm->p( 'one', $xm->span( 'two' ), 'and three' );
    # only works if $xm-> is first parameter ( __say__ workaround )
